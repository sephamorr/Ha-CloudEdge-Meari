A Home Assistant custom integration for battery-powered Wi-Fi cameras built on
the Meari cloud platform.

Meari is the underlying cloud and device platform; CloudEdge is one of its
main consumer-facing apps and services. The integration communicates directly
with the platform and cameras using the VVP / PPStrong P2P video protocol — no
third-party bridge, no Frigate plugin, and no extra container are required.

## Supported apps

The account profile must match the app used to register the account:

- CloudEdge
- CloudPlus / CloudHome
- ANRAN
- Arenti
- BoifunCam
- ieGeek

These apps use the same underlying Meari platform, but the server requires
each app's own identity during login.

---

## Highlights

- **Live MPEG-TS stream** served by HA itself — video is **copied** from
  the camera with no transcoding, so the stream carries whatever the camera
  natively produces:
  - **H.264** on the lower profiles (typically `SD`)
  - **HEVC / H.265** on the higher profiles (typically `HD`, `QHD`, `AUTO`)

  Audio (G.711 µ-law) is the only thing re-encoded, into AAC, so the result
  is a clean MPEG-TS that Frigate, go2rtc, the native HA `stream`
  component, ONVIF clients and most NVRs all accept directly.
- **Idle stream for battery cameras ("snap" cameras)** — while the camera
  is asleep, the integration keeps publishing a still-frame MPEG-TS with
  the same advertised codec / resolution / FPS as the live stream. The
  consumer (Frigate, go2rtc, mobile companion, …) **never sees the source
  disappear**, and the moment the camera wakes up the stream switches to
  live without a reconnect or a "stream lost" event.
- **Motion / AI alerts via MQTT** — battery cameras push PIR, person, pet,
  package and visitor events in real time through the Meari IoT broker.
- **Battery-camera wake control** — manual wake button, auto-wake on motion
  switch, and configurable wake duration.
- **Full settings surface** — most camera IoT toggles (LED, PIR, sirens,
  day/night, recording, anti-flicker, ONVIF, HomeKit, …) appear as native
  HA entities and write back to the camera.
- **PTZ** — `cloudplus.ptz` service for cameras that support it.
- **Multi-camera & multi-account** — one config entry per account, one
  device per camera, all created automatically after login.

---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.1+**
- A Meari-compatible app account with at least one camera already paired in
  the official app
- `ffmpeg` (bundled in HAOS, HA Container, and HA Supervised)
- Outbound internet access to the Meari cloud (HTTPS + MQTT/TLS) and UDP/TCP
  to the camera (LAN or TURN-relayed)

`pycryptodome` and `paho-mqtt` are pulled in automatically by HACS / pip.

---

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS → Integrations**.
2. Three-dot menu → **Custom repositories** → paste this repo URL → category
   **Integration**.
3. Search for *CloudEdge / CloudPlus / Meari*, install, **restart HA**.

### Manual

1. Copy [custom_components/cloudplus/](custom_components/cloudplus/) into
   `<config>/custom_components/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Setup

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Pick *CloudEdge / CloudPlus / Meari*.
3. Enter your account credentials:

   | Field         | Notes |
   |---------------|-------|
   | Email         | Same address you log into the mobile app with. |
   | Password      | Account password. |
   | Country code  | e.g. `FR`, `US`, `DE` — matches your app region. |
   | Phone code    | International dial code (e.g. `33` for France). |
   | App profile   | Choose the matching profile from [Supported apps](#supported-apps). |

4. All cameras on the account are discovered and added as individual devices.

> 💡 **Use a secondary account.** The Meari MQTT broker only allows one live
> session per account at a time. If Home Assistant logs in with the same
> account as your phone, motion events on the phone may stop arriving (and
> vice-versa). Create a second cloud account and share the camera(s) with it
> (or add it to the "family / home") before adding it to HA.

### Per-camera options

Open any camera device → **Configure**:

| Option            | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Video password    | If you enabled **E2EE / video encryption** in the app, enter that 6-digit code here so the stream can be decrypted. Leave empty otherwise. |

### Per-account options

Open the account device → **Configure** — update the password / country /
phone code / app profile in place. Changes are propagated to every camera
entry automatically.

## Entities

Every camera shows a fixed core set of entities, plus a dynamic set
discovered from the camera's IoT model values.

### Core entities

| Entity              | Platform        | Purpose |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Camera              | `camera`        | Live preview + `stream_source` for go2rtc / Frigate. |
| Activity            | `sensor`        | PIR / motion / AI alert (person, pet, package, etc.), noise and baby cry; state is `none` or the event type. |
| Camera Awake        | `binary_sensor` | True while the camera is actively streaming. |
| Charging            | `binary_sensor` | USB charging state (battery cameras). |
| Battery             | `sensor`        | Charge percentage (battery cameras). |
| Charge Status       | `sensor`        | Discharging / Charging / Full text status. |
| Wake Camera         | `button`        | Manually wake the camera. |
| Wake on Motion      | `switch`        | Toggle auto-wake when a motion event fires. |
| Motion Timeout      | `number`        | How long the camera stays awake after motion (10–600 s). |
| Stream Host Mode    | `select`        | `IP Address` (default) or `Docker Hostname` for the stream URL — see [Streaming notes](#streaming-notes). |
| Stream Quality      | `select`        | `AUTO`, `SD`, `HD`, `QHD`, … — advertised profiles, or the native HD/SD fallback for legacy cameras. |

### IoT entities (model-dependent)

The integration reads each camera's supported IoT feature codes on first
setup and exposes only those that exist. Expect a subset of:

- **Switches**: Status LED, Motion Detection, Person Detection, Human
  Tracking, Sound Detection, Crying Detection, ONVIF, SD Recording, PIR
  Sensor, Floodlight / Siren Linkage, Face Recognition, Sleep Mode, RGB
  Light, Anti-Jamming, PTZ Patrol, Laser Toy, Pet Alarm, HomeKit, Auto
  Update, OSD Watermark, Brand Logo, Sound, Lamp.
- **Numbers** (sliders): Motion / Sound / Human / PIR Sensitivity, PIR
  Interval, Floodlight Brightness & Duration, Speaker Volume, Warm Light
  Brightness.
- **Selects**: SD Record Type, Day/Night Mode, Alarm Frequency,
  Sound/Light Alarm Type, Anti-Flicker (50/60 Hz), Full Color Mode.
- **Sensors**: Temperature, Humidity (on cameras that report them).

Cameras that don't expose a feature simply won't show its entity.

### Services

| Service          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `cloudplus.ptz`  | Move (`left`/`right`/`up`/`down`) or stop a PTZ camera. Target a `camera` entity. See [services.yaml](custom_components/cloudplus/services.yaml). |

## Streaming notes

### What the camera entity exposes

The camera entity exposes its native stream as an HA-managed MPEG-TS source.

- **Video** is copied from the camera as-is. Depending on the chosen
  `Stream Quality`, the underlying codec is **H.264** (smaller, more robust
  — typically `SD`) or **HEVC / H.265** (higher quality, more fragile on
  battery cameras — typically `HD`, `QHD`, `AUTO`). Both codecs are
  delivered to consumers untouched, so quality is exactly what the camera
  produces.
- **Audio** (G.711 µ-law from the camera) is re-encoded to AAC so the
  output is a fully standard MPEG-TS.
- The result is reachable by Frigate, go2rtc, the native HA `stream`
  component, `media_player.play_media`, the HA mobile companion, ONVIF /
  RTSP clients, and most NVR-style add-ons.

### Idle stream (battery / snap cameras)

Battery cameras spend most of their life asleep — actually streaming only
while a PIR or motion event keeps them awake. Without help, consumers like
Frigate would see the source vanish every minute or two and fire a "lost
stream" event.

The integration solves this by **continuously publishing an idle stream**
while the camera is asleep:

- Same advertised codec, resolution and FPS as the live profile.
- Repeated still frame seeded from the most recent keyframe captured while
  the camera was awake (so it visually represents the actual scene).
- Low refresh cost — not re-encoded at high FPS.
- When the camera wakes up, the live frames take over **on the same TCP
  socket**, with no reconnect, no PAT/PMT renegotiation, and no client
  seeing the source go offline.

This is the difference between Frigate "just working" with these cameras
and Frigate being effectively unusable with them.

Some Meari doorbells are reported by the API as `doorbell` / `pictureDoorBell`
rather than `snap`, even though their capability map advertises `bat`. The
coordinator treats those battery-capable doorbell categories as battery
cameras so they use the same wake/idle-stream lifecycle.

### Stream Host Mode

The `Stream Host Mode` select entity controls how the public URL of the
MPEG-TS server is advertised:

- `IP Address` — uses the HA host's LAN IP (e.g. `tcp://192.168.1.10:36059`).
  Best for HAOS / HA Container with host networking, or anything that
  reaches HA directly by IP.
- `Docker Hostname` — uses the container's hostname instead. Pick this if
  Frigate / go2rtc runs in the **same Docker network** as HA and resolves
  containers by name.

### Using the stream in Frigate / go2rtc

The MPEG-TS server is internal to Home Assistant — it isn't a hardcoded
RTSP URL you can paste into Frigate's config. You need to read the actual
URL out of the live HA `camera` entity and hand it to go2rtc / Frigate
each time the stream is opened.

The easiest setup is the
[`hass-expose-camera-stream-source`](https://github.com/felipecrs/hass-expose-camera-stream-source)
integration, which exposes the live `stream_source` of any HA camera
entity over a simple HTTP endpoint:

```
GET http://<ha-host>:8123/api/camera_stream_source/<camera_entity_id>
Authorization: Bearer <long-lived-access-token>
```

The response body is the current stream URL (e.g.
`tcp://192.168.1.10:36059`). go2rtc can call that endpoint on every stream
open via its `echo:` source type, which uses the stdout of an arbitrary
command as the URL:

1. **Install** `hass-expose-camera-stream-source` (HACS, integration). No
   YAML / configuration entry needed — it just enables the endpoint.
2. **Create a long-lived access token** in HA (profile menu → bottom of
   the page → *Long-Lived Access Tokens*).
3. **Point go2rtc at the endpoint**. Example for Frigate's bundled
   go2rtc, with a camera entity named `camera.cloudplus_camera`:

   ```yaml
   # frigate config.yml
   go2rtc:
     streams:
       cloudedge-camera:
         - 'echo:curl -fsSL http://<ha-host>:8123/api/camera_stream_source/camera.cloudplus_camera
             -H "Authorization: Bearer <ha-long-lived-access-token>"'

   cameras:
     cloudedge-camera:
       ffmpeg:
         inputs:
           - path: rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/cloudedge-camera
             roles: [detect, record]
   ```

   Standalone go2rtc takes the exact same `echo:curl …` entry under its
   own `streams:` section.
4. Frigate then talks to go2rtc over RTSP, go2rtc re-resolves the HA
   endpoint each time a client connects, and you get a clean H.264 / HEVC
   feed that survives the camera sleeping (the idle stream covers the
   gap) and records / detects normally.

> 💡 If you'd rather not use the helper, you can read the `stream_source`
> attribute off the camera entity directly via the HA WebSocket or REST
> API and feed it to go2rtc however you prefer. The helper just packages
> that into a single token-protected GET.

### Deep technical details

For the underlying mechanics (KCP recovery, TURN/relay routing, HEVC
stalls, proactive `START_LIVE` re-issue, source-idle recovery), see
[docs/streaming.md](docs/streaming.md) and
[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md).

---

## Troubleshooting

A standalone CLI harness (`debug.py`) reuses the exact code path the
integration takes, so you can repro problems outside Home Assistant:

```bash
# Copy .env.example or create your own .env with EMAIL/PASSWORD/COUNTRY_CODE
python debug.py list
python debug.py stream --device-id <id> --duration 60 --quality QHD
python debug.py --debug stream --device-id <id> --duration 30  # verbose logs
```

Common issues:

- **No motion events** — another device is probably holding the Meari MQTT
  session. Use a dedicated cloud account for HA (see [Setup](#setup)).
- **Stream stalls / "few frames" on QHD** — HEVC at high bitrate is fragile
  on battery cameras; dropping to SD (which is H.264) is a useful fallback.
  See [docs/diagnosis.md](docs/diagnosis.md).
- **Camera never wakes** — deep-dormancy wakes are retried automatically
  for up to ~45 s; if it consistently fails, your account may not own the
  wake right (re-share from the app).
- **Frigate loses the source** — flip *Stream Host Mode* between `IP
  Address` and `Docker Hostname` depending on your network topology.

---

## How it works (high level)

1. **Authenticate** with the Meari HTTP API (per-app-profile host family).
2. **Subscribe** to the Meari IoT MQTT broker (TLS) for motion / AI alerts.
3. **Discover** signaling servers via the native UDP root protocol.
4. **Signal** a WebRTC-like session over TCP MsgSvr (offer/answer, ICE).
5. **Relay** data through a TURN UDP allocation (or directly on the LAN).
6. **Tunnel** with KCP (reliable ARQ over UDP) and the IVA framing layer.
7. **Control** the camera with VVP commands (`START_LIVE`, heartbeat, etc.).
8. **Decrypt** the media — H.264 *or* HEVC video (3DES-ECB when the camera
   has E2EE enabled) and G.711 µ-law audio.
9. **Mux** to MPEG-TS — video is copied (whichever codec the camera sent),
   audio is encoded to AAC — and serve to all HA / Frigate / go2rtc
   consumers via a single fan-out TCP socket. The same socket carries the
   idle still-frame stream while the camera is asleep.

Each layer is documented in detail under [docs/](docs/).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you're an AI assistant working in this repo, start with
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). If you're a human contributor, the same file is also
the fastest way to get oriented.

Before opening a PR, please:

- run `python debug.py list` and `python debug.py stream …` against your own
  camera to confirm the change doesn't break the streaming path,
- keep behaviour gated on actual evidence from local captures of the official
  app where possible,
- avoid hardcoded IPs, regions, or signaling endpoints — discovery is the
  source of truth.

## Releases

Normal pushes to `main` do not create releases. Maintainers create releases
manually from **Actions → Release Tags → Run workflow** and choose one of:

- `prerelease` — creates the next `vX.Y.Z-dev.N` release.
- `release` — creates the stable `vX.Y.Z` release.

The version in `custom_components/cloudplus/manifest.json` is the source of
truth. After publishing a stable release, bump that version before starting
the next prerelease cycle.
